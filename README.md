# GamerWordle

Daily gamer-themed Wordle-style puzzle. Each day you get:
- Deterministic 5-letter answer (UTC date seeded)
- Autogenerated category prompt (e.g. `Category: Weapons`)
- 6 classic guesses with color feedback (Green / Yellow / Gray)
- Progress bar (best correct letters so far)
- Streak, XP, Level progression (XP: 50 + 10 * unused guesses)
- Shareable result text including the category and emoji grid

## Gameplay
1. Form a 5-letter word via keyboard or onâ€‘screen keys
2. Press Enter to submit; tiles flip with feedback
3. Use color hints to refine subsequent guesses
4. Solve to extend streak & earn XP toward new levels

## Progression
- Streak: consecutive solved days (UTC). Break resets to 1 on next solve.
- XP Gain: 50 base + 10 per unused guess after solving.
- Level Curve: requirement = `300 * (1 + 0.15*(level-1))` (rounded); progress bar in header.
- Max Streak tracked locally.

## Tech Stack
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Tailwind CSS (custom Wordle-style utility classes)
- LocalStorage for game, streak, XP persistence
- Lightweight SFX (keyboard, success, failure, UI)

## Development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
```bash
npm run build
```

## Share Format

## Roadmap Ideas
- Archive browsing (re-enable prior archive feature)
- Dictionary validation & invalid word rejection
- Difficulty tiers & alternate rule sets
- Richer prompt generation (multi-hint, rarity-based)
- Accessibility & localization
